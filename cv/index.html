I'm Tom Carrick, and this is my curriculum vitae, or my resume, if you prefer. Maybe I linked this to you instead of sending a PDF, maybe I saved this as a PDF and sent it to you,or perhaps you found your own way here. </p> <p> Originally from the North-East of England, but I've been living in Amsterdam, Netherlands since the beginning of 2019. I'm a software engineer working mostly with web technologies, particularly Python / Django / PostgreSQL. Usually I'm building complex web applications with REST APIs. </p> <p> This CV is ordered in such a way that the most important things are at top, and the less useful things are at the bottom. So don't feel like you need to read the whole thing. It's also not 100% complete &mdash; there's a lot of freelance work I've excluded, as well as less relevant work experience. With that said, let's get on with it. </p> </section> <section> <h2>📇 Contact</h2> <address> <ul class=unstyled> <li><a href=mailto:tom@carrick.eu>tom@carrick.eu</a></li> <li><a href=https://github.com/knyghty>GitHub</a></li> </ul> </address> </section> <section> <h2>🧰 Skills, languages &amp; tools</h2> <ul class=skill-list> <li>🐍 Python</li> <li>🦄 Django</li> <li>⚡ FastAPI</li> <li>🐘 PostgreSQL</li> <li>📄 HTML</li> <li>🎨 CSS</li> <li>🐋 Docker</li> <li>🐙 Git</li> </ul> </section> <section> <h2>💼 Work</h2> <details open> <summary> <time datetime=2021-05>May 2021</time>–present Lead web developer at <a href=https://scene.community/ >Scene Connect</a> </summary> <ul> <li> Led development of ZuOS, an application providing energy flexibility services for energy communities. </li> <li> Designed the architecture of the platform capable of handling millions of IoT messages. </li> <li> Led a team of 5 engineers, helping with their career growth as well as with technical problems. </li> <li>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, HTML, CSS, JS.</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2022-10>October 2022</time>–March 2023 Engineering manager at <a href=https://www.lightmatter.com/ >Lightmatter</a> </summary> <ul> <li> Responsible for the growth of a team of engineers, mentoring, pair programming, reviewing performance and helping them with their career goals and to add value to the rest of the company. </li> <li>Technical leadership of multiple projects.</li> <li>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, HTML, CSS, JS.</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2020-10>October 2020</time>–<time datetime=2021-05>May 2021</time> Senior Python/Django developer at <a href=https://getstream.io/ >Stream</a> </summary> <ul> <li> Led a rewrite of the backend of the website and the customer dashboard to falicitate a new design, more functionality and better maintainability. </li> <li> Implemented new features for the public Python API libraries for the chat product. </li> <li>Conducted interviews and helped onboard a new developer.</li> <li>Python, Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch.</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2018-03>March 2018</time>–<time datetime=2020-09>September 2020</time> Python developer at <a href=https://croud.com/ >Croud</a> </summary> <ul> <li>Helped lead a rewrite of an existing PHP platform to Python / Django.</li> <li> Created a REST-powered framework for launching runs of automated tools asynchronously with complex dependency chains. </li> <li>Python, Django, Celery, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, RabbitMQ, Redis.</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2017-11>November 2017</time>–<time datetime=2020-01>January 2020</time> Senior software engineer at <a href=https://localmotors.com/ >Local Motors</a> </summary> <ul> <li> Writing the backend for Launch Forth, a collaborative engineering platform with challenges and user interaction. </li> <li>Led the migration of a large code base from Python 2 to Python 3.</li> <li>Python, Django, Celery, PostgreSQL, Redis.</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2016-02>February 2016</time>–<time datetime=2017-03>March 2017</time> Software engineer at <a href=https://www.the7bridges.com/ >7bridges</a> </summary> <ul> <li> Helped rewrite the backend code to support a complex logistics platform. </li> <li> Implemented adapters to read unstandardised logistics data from multiple couriersin different formats to a standardised database structure. </li> <li>Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2015-07>July 2015</time>–<time datetime=2016-02>February 2016</time> Software engineer at <a href=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ezhome>ezhome</a> </summary> <ul> <li>Designed and build RESTful APIs for frontend services.</li> <li>Built backend architecture for a customer management platform.</li> <li>Python, Django, PostgreSQL.</li> </ul> </details> <details> <summary> <time datetime=2013-09>September 2013</time>–<time datetime=2015-04>April 2015</time> Web developer at <a href=https://www.calmdigital.com/ >Calm Digital</a> </summary> <ul> <li>Wrote multiple fullstack websites for various clients.</li> <li> Designed and built a standard admin interface for most of the company's websiets, greatly reducing development time. </li> <li>Python, Django, PHP, WordPress, Magento, HTML, CSS, JS.</li> </ul> </details> </section> <section> <h2>💚 Volunteering, etc.</h2> <details> <summary>Open source contributions</summary> <p> I contribute to open source projects where I can.
