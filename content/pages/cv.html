        <h2>üëãüèª Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Hello. I'm Tom Carrick, and this is my curriculum vitae, or my resume,
          if you prefer. Maybe I linked this to you instead of sending a PDF,
          or perhaps you found your own way here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally from the North-East of England, but I've been living in
          Amsterdam, Netherlands since the beginning of 2019.
          I'm a software engineer working mostly with web technologies,
          particularly Python / Django / PostgreSQL. Usually I'm building complex
          web applications with REST APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This CV is ordered in such a way that the most important things are at
          top, and the less useful things are at the bottom. So don't feel like
          you need to read the whole thing. It's also not 100% complete &mdash;
          there's a lot of freelance work I've excluded, as well as less relevant
          work experience. With that said, let's get on with it.

            (<a href="https://github.com/knyghty/carbon-timeline">code</a>) is a small

            data (downloaded from Google Takeout) to estimate the carbon footprint of
            your travel using Mike Berners-Lee's (yes, Tim's brother) estimates from
            his book <cite>How Bad Are Bananas?</cite>. It's a nice project but I'm
            more than 99% sure that I'm the only perosn to ever use it.
            Maybe that will change now that you've read this?
