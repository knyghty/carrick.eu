        <h2>üëãüèª Welcome</h2>
        <p>
          Hello. I'm Tom Carrick, and this is my curriculum vitae, or my resume,
          if you prefer. Maybe I linked this to you instead of sending a PDF,
          maybe I saved this as a PDF and sent it to you,or perhaps you found
          your own way here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Originally from the North-East of England, but I've been living in
          Amsterdam, Netherlands since the beginning of 2019.
          I'm a software engineer working mostly with web technologies,
          particularly Python / Django / PostgreSQL. Usually I'm building complex
          web applications with REST APIs.
        </p>

        <p>
          This CV is ordered in such a way that the most important things are at
          top, and the less useful things are at the bottom. So don't feel like
          you need to read the whole thing. It's also not 100% complete &mdash;
          there's a lot of freelance work I've excluded, as well as less relevant
          work experience. With that said, let's get on with it.

            is an app adding keyboard shortcuts to django-admin. The intention is to
            eventually merge this into Django, but it still needs quite a bit of work,
            and ideally someone to champion it that has a bit more free time.
