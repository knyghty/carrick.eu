Hello there 👋🏻!

I'm Tom Carrick, professional web developer. I work mostly with Python,
Django, PostgreSQL, and sometimes FastAPI. I'm currently rekindling my JS skills.

The most useful thing on this site at the moment is my `CV`_. One day I might add
a blog. No promises.

My focus is on web development. Usually I work on application backends but I also
have an interest in frontend development, particularly around accessibility. As
you can perhaps tell from the design of this site, I also have an interest in keeping
page sizes down and designs uncluttered to help reduce the CO2e emissions of sites,
and I'm also interested in using infrastructure in the most efficient and least
carbon-intensive way possible.

I'm a semi-regular contributor to Django, and occasionally to other open source
projects. I sometimes coach for Django Girls workshops (pandemic permitting),
and I still don't feel like I'm doing enough.
