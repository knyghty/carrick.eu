Hello there 👋🏻

I'm Tom Carrick, professional web developer. I work mostly with Python,
Django, PostgreSQL, and sometimes FastAPI. I'm currently rekindling my JS skills,
and avoiding using them by making good use of HTMX and Alpine.js.

The most useful things on this site at the moment are the `blog`_ and my `CV`_.

My focus is on web development. Usually I work on application backends but I also
have an interest in frontend development, particularly around accessibility. As
you can perhaps tell from the design of this site, I also have an interest in keeping
page sizes down and designs uncluttered to help reduce the CO2e emissions of sites,
and I'm also interested in using infrastructure in the most efficient and least
carbon-intensive way possible.

I'm a semi-regular contributor to Django, and occasionally to other open source
projects. I run the Django Discord server, serve on the DSF board and Accessibility
Team, sometimes coach for Django Girls workshops, and I still don't feel like I'm
doing enough.

I'm currently open to short term contracts, especially if you need your code audited,
you want to ramp up your team's productivity, or you need to improve your app's
performance.
