:subtitle: About this site, not about me.

This site is made with `Pelican`_, a Python-powered static site generator.
There are a lot of SSGs out there, but I went with this one as it's written in Python,
so I can eeasily extend it if I need to.

I wrote the theme myself. It's designed to be minimalist, have semantic markup,
clean, modern CSS and use only system fonts. All these help keep the page size to a
minimum. There are currently no cookies, and no plans to add any.
This is not for any ideoligcal reason â€” I just don't need them.

The design has incorporated accessibility from the start. It should pass `WCAG 2.1`_ AA.
Getting it AAA compliant would be a lot more work for almost no benefit, so it'll only
happen if I have some free time and nothing else to do. However, that doesn't mean I
won't improve the accessibility generally.

The site is hosted on `Google Cloud`_ Storage, which is very cheap and has a very low
carbon footrpint. If there's some way I can host a static site that is a better mix
of cheap and green, do let me know.
